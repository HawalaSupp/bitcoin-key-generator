- [x] Verify that the copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory is created.
- [x] Clarify Project Requirements
  - Confirmed dual-language workspace targeting Rust and Swift development.
- [x] Scaffold the Project
  - Generated `rust-app/` Cargo binary and `swift-app/` SwiftPM executable packages.
- [x] Customize the Project
  - Added shared Makefile, build/test scripts, and documentation placeholders.
- [x] Install Required Extensions
  - No extensions were required for this setup.
- [x] Compile the Project
  - Ran `cargo build --manifest-path rust-app/Cargo.toml` and `swift build --package-path swift-app`.
- [x] Create and Run Task
  - Defined VS Code tasks in `.vscode/tasks.json` and executed the "Build Rust" task successfully.
- [x] Launch the Project
  - **ALWAYS** launch the Hawala Swift app using `swift run swift-app` from the `/Users/x/Desktop/888/swift-app` directory.
  - This ensures the latest code is loaded and runs in the terminal's process context (not as a separate Dock app).
  - **NEVER** use `open` commands to launch the app, as they load outdated cached versions.
  - To stop: Press Ctrl+C or use `pkill -f "swift run swift-app"`.
- [x] Ensure Documentation is Complete
  - README.md and docs/ placeholders created; this file now reflects the latest project status without HTML comments.
- Work through each checklist item systematically.
- Keep communication concise and focused.
- Follow development best practices.
